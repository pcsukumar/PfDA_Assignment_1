This hypotheis suggestes that children's moderate level of digital media engagement is beneficial to their psychiatric wellbeing, while lower, or higher levels may be detrimental. The aim of this project is to create a synthetic dataset which contains variables such as; gender, average daily screen time, and a measure of psychological/emotional well-being of people in the adolocent age group."
