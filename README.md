### Generating a synthetic dataset to test digital 'Goldilocks hypothesis' among adolocent population in Ireland

This project attempts to create a dataset to test the 'digital Goldilocks hypothesis' which posits that children's moderate level of digital media engagement is beneficial to their psychiatric wellbeing, while lower, or higher levels may be detrimental. The aim of this project is to create a synthetic dataset which contains variables such as; family income, age, gender, average daily screen time, and a measure of psychological/emotional well-being of people in the adolocent age group.

This project is created on a Jupyter notebook, which can be run on jupyter notebook environment.
